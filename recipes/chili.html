        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My father and I created this easy 5-ingredient chili recipe and everyone we have made it for loved it. It is fast, simple, and delicious.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>1 pound <strong>lean ground beef.</strong></li>
            <li>15 ounces <strong>tomato sauce.</strong></li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can <strong>kidney beans</strong>, drained.</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can <strong>chili beans</strong>, not drained.</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons <strong>chili powder</strong>, or to taste.</li>
            <li>Salt and <strong>freshly ground black pepper</strong> to taste.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef  in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in kidney beans, chili beans, and tomato sauce. Bring to a boil and stir in chili powder. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
